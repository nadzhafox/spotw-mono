        // but basically, the idea is that the factory function takes optional input arguments which,
        // if specified, are resolved by injecting a provider from the inject property array.

        //  which is our single private instance of the ConfigService.
        // So, Nest is going to instantiate a ConfigService inside the dynamic module context (this makes sense, right? We told our module to useClass,
        //  which means "create your own instance"), and that will be injected into the factory.
