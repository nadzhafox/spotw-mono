- ~~docker-compose yaml~~
- ~~postgres with postgis extension~~ 
- ~~configuration apps(vault is blocked, use redis instead)~~
    - configuration before start env managment
    - configuration at run time connect to some secret key store
    - configuration of each app is boilerplate code mb use lib for app



Vault is blocked and forbidden to download with vpn, so use redis with creating only read user. Too much reading redis doc for creating config user and set acl rules.
