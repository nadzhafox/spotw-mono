imagine task for today:

- remove nestjs-cli use lerna
- start all apps with one command
- hot reload (when changes in lib)

achievement:
- remove nestjs-cli
- remove lerna for now, pnpm can run parallel tasks
- use pmpm workspace with understanding sym links
- start 2 apps with one command

what's left:
- somehow add common lib on 2 apps with hotreload after changes (mb watchmode or nodemon)
